# Blockless Functions

Blockless Functions is a **decentralized** and **verifiable** serverless platform that lets you run code for any types of application and backend service in response to on-chain and cloud events. With Blockless Functions, you no longer need to provision and manage servers or node networks, saving you time and resources. 

## Security & Scalability

Blockless Functions platform is built on top of the Blockless Protocol with security and scalability in mind. As a result, the platform offers high availability and reliability for your growing demand and usage.

## Service Oriented

The Blockless Functions platform integrates seamlessly with many services and extensions, such as blockchain RPCs, decentralized data oracle, data caching, and etc., providing a flexible and cost-effective way to build and deploy decentralized applications.

## Initial Node Offerings

Functions can be deployed to a fully-customizable service environment that consists of an arbitrary number of worker instances, assembling a function-specific subnetwork or shard. The subnetwork can also be dynamically load-balanced with varying incoming load.
