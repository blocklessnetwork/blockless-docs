# Fee Distribution in the Blockless Execution Network

In the Blockless execution network, the primary economic incentive for node participation is direct payments from developers who deploy and run applications on Blockless.

When a developer deploys a function, they deposit funds into a smart contract wallet authorized to conduct payments for invocations. When a function is invoked, the nodes selected for execution check with the orchestration chain to confirm that the owner of the function has sufficient funds available for the execution.

Four times a day, the orchestration chain collects payments from authorized wallets and distributes rewards to nodes in the execution network. The fee collected is distributed as follows:

1. **Execution Nodes** - 80%
2. **Token Burn** - 10%
3. **Protocol Grants** - 10%

## **Payment Types:**

For the mainnet, Blockless offers two pricing mechanisms: Pay-as-you-go, where users pay for Blockless Functions based on the resources their invocations consume, and Timed Payment, where users pay for Blockless App Engine according to how long they wish to rent and utilize dedicated servers.

## **Node and User Staking:**

Aspiring execution node operators must stake the Blockless (BLS) token to join the network. The amount of work a node can perform depends on its hardware capacity and the amount of BLS staked. Developers can also stake BLS tokens to unlock additional benefits, such as discounted rates and access to new Blockless Hosted Services.
