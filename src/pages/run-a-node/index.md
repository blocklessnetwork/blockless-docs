# Blockless Nodes
The [Blockless Network](../network) is powered by distributed nodes, which are hardware devices contributing CPU/GPU, RAM, and bandwidth to verifiably execute workloads in return for service rewards, forming a peer-to-peer computing network.

Nodes can join the network by installing the node client, which runs the Blockless Runtime, a secure WASM-based execution environment, and communicates with other nodes via the Blockless Networking Module [b7s](../reference/networking.md).

The Bless Network is currently in its incentivized Testnet phase. Please note that the node client is not part of this phase. To participate in our Testnet, you can download and run our [Chrome Extension Worker Node here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bless/pljbjcehnhcnofmkdbjolghdcjnmekia?pli=1).
