# Blockless Nodes
The [Blockless Network](../network) is powered by distributed nodes, which are hardware devices contributing CPU/GPU, RAM, and bandwidth to verifiably execute workloads in return for service rewards, forming a peer-to-peer computing network.

Nodes can join the network by installing the node client, which runs the Blockless Runtime, a secure WASM-based execution environment, and communicates with other nodes via the Blockless Networking Module [b7s](../reference/networking.md).

Currently, the Blockless Network is in the pre-testnet phase, with ongoing optimizations for each new release and the documentation subject to further updates.
