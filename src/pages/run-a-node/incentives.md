# Incentives
Reward emission follows an exponential decay function of time, to incentivize stakers to contribute security and node operators to contribute hardware resources to the network. 

Node operators can request immediate withdrawal of rewards, which are distributed upon such requests.

Please note that the incentive module is not enabled in the current release.
