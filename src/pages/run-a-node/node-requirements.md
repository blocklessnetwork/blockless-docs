# Node Requirements
To join the network, a node must meet both staking and hardware requirements.

## Staking
The Blockless Network supports multi-asset staking, including re-staked ETH and other assets approved by the foundation under DAO governance. Each node tier requires a fixed stake amount based on its hardware capacity, providing economic security and technical security measures.

The network allows both native staking and delegated proof-of-stake. At testnet launch, a communal staking pool will be evenly distributed to node operators following a whitelisting process.

Please note that staking is not enabled in the current release.
