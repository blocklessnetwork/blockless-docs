# Service Terms
Orchestration Nodes have to commit to a 30-day cycle minimum.

Worker Nodes have the flexibility to operate on a freelance basis with no time commitment or can choose to commit to a multiple of 30-day period(s). Upon deciding to exit, a time-based Worker Node must submit a withdrawal request and then wait 30 days to be removed from the active set, after which it can unstake and withdraw all accrued rewards.

To incentivize stability and long-term participation, the network offers an accrued-time bonus. This bonus is calculated as a function of the duration for which a node has been active and continuously running.
